# customerOrganization
In this Java project, I use many principles of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) to create an easy and abstract way of holding customer information. This project is an exemplification of the idea of superclasses - everyone is a human, and for the sake of abstraction, every human has some ubiquitous attribute (i.e. name). Humans when contextualized (like the case of a customer) can have different attributes not shared with the generic superclass (human), and can be attributed specific principles to their specific status. The idea of using a shared status (in this case, human) is a simple case of what is a superclass and these methodologies are extremely useful for abstraction purposes.
